# SunNet Project Knowledge Base

## Project Overview
[cite_start]SunNet is a web application that uses machine learning to predict solar energy generation based on meteorological data[cite: 2, 3]. [cite_start]It was developed by a team of four students—Husain Ghulam, Shreesh Jugade, Ayush Shevde, and Tanishk Deshpande—for the TechRush Hackathon 2025[cite: 3]. [cite_start]The project's goal is to provide an accurate and accessible tool for forecasting solar power[cite: 3].

## The Machine Learning Model
[cite_start]The core of SunNet is a sophisticated two-stage predictive model designed for efficiency and accuracy[cite: 5].

### Stage 1: Classification
[cite_start]First, a binary classification model (Random Forest Regressor) determines if any solar power can be generated[cite: 7]. [cite_start]It essentially answers the question: "Is it daytime and are conditions suitable for power generation?"[cite: 8]. [cite_start]If the model predicts that zero power will be generated, the process stops, saving computational resources[cite: 9].

### Stage 2: Ensemble Regression
[cite_start]If the classifier determines that power generation is possible, the data is passed to a weighted ensemble of three powerful regression models[cite: 11]:
* [cite_start]**Random Forest (RF):** A robust model good at handling complex feature interactions[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**XGBoost:** A highly efficient and powerful gradient-boosting model[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**LightGBM (LGBM):** A memory-efficient and fast gradient-boosting model[cite: 15].

[cite_start]The final prediction is a weighted average of the outputs from these three models: **20% RF, 40% XGBoost, and 40% LGBM**[cite: 16]. [cite_start]This ensemble approach makes the final prediction more stable and reliable than any single model could achieve[cite: 17].

## Model Performance and Accuracy
The model's performance has been rigorously tested and validated.

### Key Performance Metrics
* [cite_start]**R-squared ($R^2$) Score:** **0.9124**[cite: 18]. [cite_start]This indicates that the model explains over 91% of the variance in the solar power data, signifying a very strong fit[cite: 18].
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** **1428.91 W**. On average, the model's prediction is off by approximately 1429 Watts.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** **3103.88 W**. This metric gives a higher weight to larger errors, indicating the standard deviation of the prediction errors.

### Predicted vs. Actual Power
The scatter plot of predicted versus actual power shows the model's effectiveness. The predictions (blue dots) form a tight cluster around the red dashed line, which represents a perfect prediction. This visual evidence confirms the high R² score and the model's reliability across different power output levels.



### Zero Prediction Analysis
The first-stage classifier is highly effective at identifying when no power will be generated (e.g., at night).
* **Actual Zeros in Test Data:** 251 instances.
* **Correctly Predicted Zeros:** 238 instances.
* **False Positives (Predicted Power > 0, Actual = 0):** 13 instances.
* **False Negatives (Predicted Power = 0, Actual > 0):** 14 instances.
This results in an accuracy of **94.8%** for correctly identifying zero-power conditions.

## Features and Feature Engineering
The model uses historical weather data and enhances it with several engineered features to improve accuracy.

### Input Weather Features
* [cite_start]**Temperature (°F):** Correlated with sunny weather, though extreme heat can reduce panel efficiency[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Humidity (%):** High humidity can be associated with cloud cover or condensation[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]**Wind Speed (mph):** Wind provides a cooling effect that can slightly increase efficiency[cite: 22].
* [cite_start]**Sky Cover (0-8):** A crucial feature where 0 is a clear sky and 8 is completely overcast[cite: 23].
* [cite_start]**Visibility (mi):** Low visibility from fog, haze, or pollution blocks sunlight[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**Distance to Solar Noon:** A calculated feature representing the time difference from peak sunlight (around 12:30 PM)[cite: 26]. [cite_start]A value closer to 0 means more direct sun and higher power[cite: 27].

### Engineered Features
These features are created from the raw data to capture more complex relationships:
* **temp_squared:** Captures the non-linear effect of extreme heat on panel efficiency.
* **wind_speed_humidity:** A proxy for conditions like mist or fog that can affect solar irradiance.
* **daylight_factor:** Approximates the sun's angle to better model the power curve throughout the day.
* **rain_or_fog_likelihood:** A flag for conditions where rain or fog are likely (high sky cover, high humidity, low visibility).
* **pollution_proxy:** A flag for potential air pollution or haze (low visibility combined with low atmospheric pressure).
* **dew_morning_risk:** Identifies cold, humid mornings where dew or frost on panels could reduce initial output.

## General Solar Energy Information

### Q: How do solar panels work?
[cite_start]A: Solar panels are made of photovoltaic (PV) cells[cite: 31]. [cite_start]When sunlight hits these cells, it creates a direct current (DC) of electricity[cite: 31]. [cite_start]An inverter then changes this DC power to alternating current (AC) power that can be used in homes and businesses[cite: 32].

### Q: What are the main factors affecting solar panel output?
A: The primary factors are:
1.  [cite_start]**Irradiance:** The amount of solar energy hitting the panel[cite: 35].
2.  [cite_start]**Temperature:** Panels are less efficient at very high temperatures[cite: 37].
3.  [cite_start]**Shading:** Even small shadows can significantly reduce output[cite: 38].
4.  [cite_start]**Panel Orientation and Tilt:** The angle of the panel relative to the sun[cite: 39].
5.  [cite_start]**Cleanliness:** Dust, dirt, or snow can block sunlight and reduce efficiency by up to 25%[cite: 40, 66].

### Fun Solar Facts
* [cite_start]The sun sends enough energy to Earth in **one hour** to power the entire world for a year[cite: 64].
* [cite_start]Cool, sunny days can generate more power than very hot, sunny days because panels are more efficient in cooler temperatures[cite: 65].
