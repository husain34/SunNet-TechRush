# SunNet-TechRush
A machine learning model to predict solar energy generation using historical weather data. Incorporates features like temperature, cloud cover, and seasonal patterns for accurate forecasting. Built by Team SunNet for TechRush Hackathon, PISB focused on sustainable energy solutions.

## ðŸ§ª Model Experiments

This folder contains the experimental scripts used for training, evaluating, and comparing different machine learning models for solar energy prediction.

ðŸ“‚ `src/experiments/` includes:

- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- NGBoost
- Weighted Ensemble Models

Each script trains a model or evaluates it using scoring metrics like RMSE, MAE, RÂ².

ðŸ“Œ These  are testing and experimentation scripts that guide model selection.
